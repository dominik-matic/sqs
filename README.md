# SQS

A simple, yet intuitive C++ library for quantum simulation designed to demonstrate the principles of quantum computation.

This project includes all of the files relevant to my Undergraduate Thesis. It includes the code for the simulator, as well as the LaTeX files needed to compile the written thesis.
